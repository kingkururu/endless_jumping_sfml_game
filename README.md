## Description of SFML Game Template

This repository provides a foundational template for building 2D games using C++ and SFML. It's designed for basic game features like game loops, asset management, physics, and scene management. Built with Visual Studio Code, this setup should also work in other environments that support Makefile builds.



## Features

Game Manager: Manages game loop, scenes, and input.


Scenes: Handles specialized events for different states.


Sprites:
Extends sf::Sprite
- Static vs. Non-Static
- Animated vs. Non-Animated


Fonts: Customizes sf::Text for typography.


Sounds: Extends sf::Sound and sf::Music for audio control.


Tiles & Tilemap:
- Loads tilemaps from text files
- Includes very basic random map generator


Logging: Toggle logging per state with macros.
- includes a timer (thanks to cherno: https://gist.github.com/TheCherno/b2c71c9291a4a1a29c889e76173c8d14) 
- uses multi-threading 


Physics:
- AABB and Circle collision
- Pixel-perfect collision detection
- Raycast precollision detection
- Quadtree implementation 



Constants & Globals: Configured via YAML files.


Note: This template does not include a UI layer for customization. Changes must be made directly in the code to implement specific game functionality.







## Prerequisites

-   Compiler: Requires clang++ (or g++) with support for C++17
-   SFML: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for graphics, windowing, and audio.
-   Homebrew (macOS): Setup includes steps to auto-install Homebrew and dependencies if missing.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
  git clone <https://github.com/kingkururu/sfml_game_template>
  cd sfml_game_template
```

2. Build the Project
Open Visual Studio Code, navigate to the project directory, and run:
```bash
  make test
```
This will:

-   Install Homebrew if missing.
-   Install sfml, spdlog, and fmt via Homebrew.
-   Compile and build the project executable.
-   Run the game.

3. Clean the Build
Remove compiled files with:
```bash
  make clean
```

## Dependencies
-   SFML: For graphics, windowing, and audio handling.
-   spdlog: Logging support for debug and error tracking.
-   fmt: Text formatting library for logging
-   catch2: For testing purpooses

Note: Adjust file paths, include dependencies, and modify other sections based on your environment, as some systems may require manual setup for Homebrew or custom paths.
